# Practothon-22-10-nearest-neighbours

import the given project in some IDE for java.
I have used Intellij by JetBrains.
java version used is 1.8

After importing the project follow following steps.

1. Go to executorClass.java file and run the main method in this class.
2. This will create the data as well as query point.
3. after that nearest neighbours will be calculated for the query point.
4. The execution time and distance of nearest neighbours is printed on the console.
5. for subsequent execution of query points we dont need to create the data again, hence comment the line :-  float[][] readDataFromFile = InputDataHandler.readDataFromFile("data.txt",numberOfDataVectors);
6. This will only create new query point and give nearest neighours on the same data.
